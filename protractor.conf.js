     * A callback function called once protractor is ready and available, and
     * before the specs are executed. If multiple capabilities are being run,
     * this will run once per capability.
     *
     * You can specify a file containing code to run by setting onPrepare to
     * the filename string. onPrepare can optionally return a promise, which
     * Protractor will wait for before continuing execution. This can be used if
     * the preparation involves any asynchronous calls, e.g. interacting with
     * the browser. Otherwise Protractor cannot guarantee order of execution
     * and may start the specs before preparation finishes.
     *
     * At this point, global variable 'protractor' object will be set up, and
     * globals from the test framework will be available. For example, if you
     * are using Jasmine, you can add a reporter with:
     *
     *    jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new jasmine.JUnitXmlReporter(
     *      'outputdir/', true, true));
     *
     * If you need access back to the current configuration object,
     * use a pattern like the following:
     *
     *    return browser.getProcessedConfig().then(function(config) {
     *      // config.capabilities is the CURRENT capability being run, if
     *      // you are using multiCapabilities.
     *      console.log('Executing capability', config.capabilities);
     *    });
